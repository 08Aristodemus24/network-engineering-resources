# To do:

# Insights:
* I already know some linux, linux command line operations like ssh, scp, etc. through learning docker, docker compose, and using VMs in my previous usage of COAREs services in my undergrad dissertation, I already know using windows services by  

## learn the following
learn how data moves from one layer to another
layer 2 switching layer 3 routing
tcp ip model
subnetting
divide network into smaller ones efficeintly
vlance (how to traffic inside a network)
networking runs on protocols
protocol range from DNS, DHCP, BGP, OSPF, HTTP, HTTPS, FTTP, SSH
cisco networking academy for free courses
network+

## get certified
comptia+ certification
coptia all in one mike myers

CCNA (cisco certified network associate) 300$
neil anderson udemy course
cisco netowrking officail CCNA book

net+ certification 369$
professor youtube channel

## do projects
you will need to get your hands on hardware like routers using ethernet cables etc.

next step is building and configuring networks

this can either be done by 1 building a home lab itself which requires you to purchase routers, switches, and configure firewalls with these devices but 2 you can also virtualize building these networks themselves by using cisco's packet tracer application allowing you through diagrams connect stuff and what have you and build a network and configure a firewall etc. without having to do it in real life and purchasing shit.

hardware route:
Cisco catalyst 2960/2750 50$
cisco isr 2900 series 100$
extreme g2 layer 3 sswitch 200$
ex4300 series 100$
unified access point
palo alto 820 (used)

virtual app:
* cisco packet tracer
* gns3 (for real world setups)
* evneng



## after learning, certification, and creating projects in your job search you need to start either in the following roles before even landing a junior network engineering role:
IT helpdesk analyst
IT helpdesk 
ISP (internet service provider) technician
IT support technician

# Articles, videos, papers, etc.
